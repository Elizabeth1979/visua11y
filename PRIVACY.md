# Privacy Notice

Visua11y processes page content locally and uses AI services only when a user requests a feature (Summarize, TLDR, Page Layout Analysis).

## What We Process

- Summarize selection: the text you select is sent to the chosen AI backend (Chrome Built‑in AI when available; otherwise OpenAI using your key).
- TLDR: the extension collects the page title, URL, meta description (if present), and up to ~8,000 characters of visible page text and sends this to OpenAI when you request a TLDR.
- Page Layout Analysis: a screenshot of the current page is captured and sent to OpenAI for analysis when you request it.

## What We Don’t Collect

- We do not collect or store your browsing history.
- We do not run analytics.
- We do not transmit data automatically; actions are user‑initiated.

## Keys and Storage

- Your OpenAI API key is stored in the extension’s storage area and is not exposed to web pages.
- Keys are masked in the UI; you can remove them at any time.

## Third‑Party Services

- OpenAI API: content you submit when invoking AI features is sent to OpenAI under their terms and data policies.
