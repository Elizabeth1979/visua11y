# Security: Protect API keys and sensitive configuration
# (Keep any files that might contain API keys out of git)
# Old developer config file with API keys — do not commit
background/config.js
# JSON config file that previously contained keys — do not commit
background/config.json

# System files
# macOS Finder metadata — automatically created, not source
.DS_Store
# Local VS Code settings — personal to each developer
.vscode/
# Log files from debugging — not source code
*.log

# Extension packaging
# Packed Chrome extension file (created by "Pack extension")
*.crx
# Private key used to sign the extension — highly sensitive, never commit
*.pem
# Release zip uploaded to the Chrome Web Store — build artifact
*.zip
# Build output directory (if a bundler is used) — generated files
